\section{Paper}

Each manuscript should be submitted on \textbf{A4 paper.} The fully
justified text should be formatted in two parallel columns, each 8.25 cm wide,
and separated by a space of 0.63 cm. Left, right, and bottom margins should be
1.9 cm. and the top margin 2.5 cm. The font for the main body of the text should
be Times 10 pt with interlinear spacing of 12 pt.  \textbf{Articles must be
between 2 and 4 pages in length}.

\section{General Instructions}

Each paper is allocated between \underline{\textbf{a mi\-ni\-mum of two}}
\textbf{\underline{and a maximum of four pages}} including figures. %\newline

Do not print the page number.

\section{Page Numbering}

\textbf{Please do not include page numbers in your article.} The definitive page
numbering of articles published in the proceedings will be decided by the
organizing committee.

\section{Headings / Level 1 Headings}

Headings should be capitalised in the same way as the main title, and centred
within the column. The font used is Times 12 bold. There should also be a space
of 12 pt between the title and the preceding section, and a space of 3 pt
between the title and the text following it.

\subsection{Level 2 Headings}

The format for level 2 headings is the same as for level 1 Headings, with the
font Times 11, and the heading is justified to the left of the column.

\subsubsection{Level 3 Headings}

The format for level 3 headings is the same as for level 2 headings, except that
the font is Times 10, and there should be no space left between the heading and
the text.

%\subsubsection{Example of a sub-subsection with a long heading that will occupy two lines}

%Yet another example of a sub-subsection. Yet another example of a sub-subsection. Yet another example of a sub-subsection. Yet another example of a sub-subsection. Yet another example of a sub-subsection.

\section{Citing References in the Text}

\subsection{Bibliographical References}

All bibliographical references within the text should be placed in parentheses
containing the author's surname followed by a comma before the date of
publication \cite{Martin-90}. If the sentence already includes the author's
name, then it is only necessary to put the date in parentheses:
\newcite{Martin-90}. When several authors are cited, those references should be
separated with a semicolon: \cite{Martin-90,CastorPollux-92}. When the reference
has more than three authors, only cite the name of the first author followed by
et al. (e.g. \cite{Superman-Batman-Catwoman-Spiderman-00}).

\section{Figures \& Tables}
\subsection{Figures}

All figures should be centred and clearly distinguishable. They should never be
drawn by hand, and the lines must be very dark in order to ensure a high-quality
printed version. Figures should be numbered in the text, and have a caption in
Times 10 pt underneath. A space must be left between each figure and its
respective caption. 

Example of a figure enclosed in a box:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
%\fbox{\parbox{6cm}{
%This is a figure with a caption.}}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image1.eps} 
\caption{The caption of the figure.}
\label{fig.1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure and caption should always appear together on the same page. Large figures
can be centred, using a full page.
%NB: an example of large figures is missing.  \newpage

\subsection{Tables}

The instructions for tables are the same as for figures.
%Two types of tables are distinguished: in-column and big tables that don't fit in the columns.
%\subsection{In-column tables}
%An example of an in-column table is presented here.
%
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

      \hline
      Level&Tools\\
      \hline\hline
      Morphology & Pitrat Analyser\\
      Syntax & LFG Analyser (C-Structure)\\
     % Semantics & LFG F-Structures + Sowa's\\
     % & Conceptual Graphs\\
      \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{The caption of the table}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

%\subsection{Big tables}
%
%An example of a big table which extends beyond the column and will
%float in the next page.

% \begin{table*}[ht]

%       \hline
%
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{The caption of the big table}
% \end{center}
% \end{table*}
%

\section{Footnotes}

Footnotes are indicated within the text by a number in superscript\footnote{They
should be in Times 9, and appear at the bottom of the same page as their
corresponding number. Footnotes should also be separated from the rest of the
text by a horizontal line 5 cm long.}.

\section{Acknowledgements}

Place all acknowledgements (including those concerning research grants and
funding) in a separate section at the end of the article.

\section{ References}

Bibliographical references should be listed in alphabetical order at the
end of the article. The title of the section, ``Bibliographical References'',
should be a level 1 heading. The first line of each bibliographical reference
should be justified to the left of the column, and the rest of the entry should
be indented by 0.35 cm.

The examples provided in Section \ref{main:ref} (some of which are fictitious
references) illustrate the basic format required for articles in conference
proceedings, books, journals articles, Ph.D. theses, and chapters of books.
